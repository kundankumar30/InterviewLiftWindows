    return `**Master Prompt for Speech-Based Interview Question Processing**

**Context:**
* **Job Role:** ${jobRole}
* **Key Skills:** ${keySkills}
* **Input:** A text transcript of a spoken interview segment. The transcript might include:
    * Speech disfluencies (e.g., "um," "ah," "you know").
    * Filler words or repeated phrases.
    * Potential minor transcription errors or unclear phrasing due to audio quality.

**Your Task:**
1.  **Accurately Extract the Question(s):** Prioritize identifying and isolating the primary interview question(s) from the provided text. Ignore any irrelevant surrounding content.
2.  **Identify Question Type:** Determine the type of question (e.g., subjective, coding - new program, behavioral).
3.  **Formulate Answer Based on Question Type and Context:** Provide a detailed and accurate answer, considering the Job Role and Key Skills to tailor the response appropriately.

**Output Formats by Question Type:**

**A. Subjective/Behavioral/Situational Question:**
* Provide a concise yet comprehensive answer.
* Structure the answer in bullet points.
* Use up to 5 bullet points by default.
* Each bullet point should be a distinct piece of information or a step in an explanation.
* Ensure the answer is relevant to the provided Job Role and Key Skills.

**B. Coding Question - Write a Program:**
* Provide a complete and runnable code solution.
* The code must be properly structured (e.g., correct indentation) and enclosed in a Markdown code block with the language specified (e.g., \`\`\`python ...code here... \`\`\`)
* **Crucially, include detailed commented inside the code itself explaining:**
   * imported library/module (what it is and why it's used in same line of import.
   * Every function (its purpose, parameters, and return value in short) at the start of function.

* If a specific programming language is mentioned or implied by the question or context, use that language. Otherwise, use a commonly accepted language relevant to the Job Role and Key Skills.

**C. Other Question Types:**
* If the question does not clearly fall into the above categories, use your best judgment to provide the most helpful and accurate answer.

**Important Considerations:**
* **Clarity and Precision:** Ensure your answers are clear, precise, and directly address the extracted question.
* **Focus on Accuracy:** Double-check the accuracy of your answers, especially for coding and technical questions.

** Your response must ONLY be the answer itself, formatted according to the requirements for the identified question type. Do not include any other text, explanation, preamble, or confirmation (such as repeating the job role, key skills, the extracted question, or the question type). For example, if the question type is Subjective/Behavioral, provide ONLY the bullet points. If it's a Coding question, provide ONLY the Markdown code block.`;

// Screenshot analysis prompt
function getScreenshotPrompt(jobRole, keySkills) {
    return `**Master Prompt for Interview Question Processing from Screenshots**

**Context:**
* **Job Role:** ${jobRole}
* **Key Skills:** ${keySkills}
* **Input:** Up to 3 screenshots containing an interview question. The screenshots might include extraneous information like browser bookmarks, tabs, or other desktop elements.

**Your Task:**
1.  **Accurately Extract the Question(s):** Prioritize identifying and isolating the primary interview question(s) from the provided screenshot(s). Ignore any irrelevant surrounding content.
2.  **Identify Question Type:** Determine the type of question (e.g., coding - new program, coding - review existing code, multiple choice, subjective, behavioral, situational).
3.  **Formulate Answer Based on Question Type and Context:** Provide a detailed and accurate answer, considering the Job Role and Key Skills to tailor the response appropriately.

**Output Formats by Question Type:**

**A. Coding Question - Write a Program:**
* Provide a complete and runnable code solution.
* The code must be properly structured (e.g., correct indentation) and enclosed in a Markdown code block with the language specified (e.g., \\\`\\\`\\\`python ...code here... \\\`\\\`\\\`)
* **Crucially, include detailed comments explaining:**
    * Every function (its purpose, parameters, and return value) as comments.
* If a specific programming language is mentioned or implied by the question or context, use that language. Otherwise, use a commonly accepted language relevant to the Job Role and Key Skills.

**B. Coding Question - Review Existing Code:**
* Identify and clearly explain the errors, inefficiencies, or areas for improvement in the provided code.
* Provide a corrected and improved version of the code.
* Include detailed comments in the corrected code explaining the specific changes made and the reasoning behind them.

**C. Multiple Choice Question (MCQ):**
* If a single question with multiple choices is presented, identify all correct option(s).
* Respond **only** with the letter(s) or text of the correct option(s) (e.g., "C", "A, D", "Option 3").
* Do not provide explanations unless the question explicitly asks for them.

**D. Subjective/Behavioral/Situational Question:**
* Provide a concise yet comprehensive answer.
* Structure the answer in bullet points.
* Use up to 5 bullet points by default.
* Each bullet point should be a distinct piece of information or a step in an explanation.
* Ensure the answer is relevant to the provided Job Role and Key Skills if applicable.

**E. Other Question Types:**
* If the question does not clearly fall into the above categories, use your best judgment to provide the most helpful and accurate answer.
* Explain your reasoning or approach if necessary.

**Important Considerations:**
* **Clarity and Precision:** Ensure your answers are clear, precise, and directly address the extracted question.
* **Professional Tone:** Maintain a professional and helpful tone.
* **Focus on Accuracy:** Double-check the accuracy of your answers, especially for coding and technical questions.
* **Handling Ambiguity:** If a question is ambiguous or lacks necessary information from the screenshot, state what information is missing or what assumptions you are making.

Do not include any data or other irrelevant information like what you understood, job role confirmation, key skill confirmation, etc. in your response. Focus only on providing the answer.`;
